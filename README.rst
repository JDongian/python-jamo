Python-jamo is a Python Hangul syllable decomposition and synthesis library
for working with Hangul characters and jamo.

Currently in beta release, function names are subject to change, but there is
coverage for nearly all Hangul-related codepoints under Unicode 7.0.

Originally designed to help students identify difficult-to-spell words
containing (ㅔ,ㅐ) or (ㅗ,ㅜ), this project hopes to fill the niche of Korean
phonetic and spelling analysis.


Installation
------------

To install Jamo from `pypi`_, simply:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install jamo

The jamo module is Python 3 only. Viva the bleeding edge!
